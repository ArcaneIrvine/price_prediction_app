# price_prediction_app
This is a personal project made to enchance my data analysis and web applications skills using python and flask. Its purpose is analysing data using yfinance and predicting future price of a cryptocurrency pair the user chooses.

this project can also be found in http://struggl3r.pythonanywhere.com/ (keep in mind this is a free hosting service so depending on when you try to load it it might be down or removed)

alternatively you can simply run 'main.py' after downloading to test it out
